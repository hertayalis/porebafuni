Rather than cast someone else, Lear decided to keep George offscreen until Hemsley was available.</p><p>Until then, Lear created the character of Henry Jefferson, George's brother. Portrayed by Mel Stewart, Henry got the lines and screen time that would have gone to George. At least, he did until Hemsley became available—Stewart's last appearance as Henry was Hemsley's first appearance as George. Henry Jefferson was never seen again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FlHJnbWxfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2ptaZ5yZ6dn52iqLyvv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
