A mutual friend introduced the two, and a few months later, Lennon asked McCartney to join the group. It evolved into the Beatles, with Lennon and McCartney as the main singer/songwriters.</p><p dir=ltr>By the time the band broke up,&nbsp;the two were at each other's throats. They wrote each other angry letters, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Ultimate Classic Rock</a> reports that both men wrote insult songs directed at each other. McCartney's included "Too Many People," and Lennon's response was "How Do You Sleep?," which features the lyrics "The only thing you done was 'Yesterday' / And since you've gone, you're just 'Another Day.'"</p><p dir=ltr>The two eventually reconciled and maintained contact over the final years of Lennon's life, with McCartney saying, "We just talked kids and baking bread."&nbsp;<a href=#>McCartney has also said</a>&nbsp;that their last conversation before Lennon's murder was friendly. Linda McCartney said that Lennon's final words to McCartney were, "think about me every now and then, old friend."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkXFrcG1fqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dpa62uIymmpyZoqm7psWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
