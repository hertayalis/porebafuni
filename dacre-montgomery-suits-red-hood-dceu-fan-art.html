However, now that the franchise is going in a different direction with the Bat-mythos – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight will be much younger</a> and less-experienced than Ben Affleck’s – it doesn’t look like the former sidekick-turned-anti-hero is on the table at the moment.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>But there’s no harm in still dreaming, right? As fans want to see Red Hood in the DCEU so badly, it seems the internet has chosen one candidate to play him above all others: Stranger Things&nbsp;star Dacre Montgomery. If you’re struggling to see Billy Hargrove in the part, then maybe this awesome piece of fan art will help you out.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Instagram artist Willgray_art shared the below design this week, which puts Montgomery in the Red Hood outfit, complete with jacket and helmet in his hands. The cigarette in his mouth is a nice touch that adds to the character’s attitude as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dacre-Montgomery-Red-Hood-Fan-Art.jpg><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>Montgomery’s definitely got a knack for playing layered anti-heroes, but unfortunately, it sounds like the actor isn’t particularly interested in playing this one, or entering the DC (or Marvel) universe at all. When asked about possibly portraying Red Hood, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told GQ</a> that he’d “love to dive into a different world that we don’t know, that we aren’t kind of given a lot of both in television format and cinema.”</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>This follows on from the star’s comments that he’s also done with the&nbsp;Power Rangers&nbsp;franchise as he spilled the beans that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hasbro are planning on rebooting the series</a> without the cast of the 2017 movie. Both of these updates will likely upset Montgomery’s fans who were hoping to see him make his mark on the superhero genre.</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=false>With that in mind, tell us, who would you like to see play <strong>Red Hood</strong> in the DCEU?
