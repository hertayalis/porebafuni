I worked out, I ate well, and there were things that I just could not change. And that is because I had a ten-pound baby, and every mother knows that things are very different after that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633245695.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000630171814-1.png><p>Though this was her first procedure of the kind, Madison entrusted Charleston-based surgeon, Dr. Patrick J. O’Neill, to get the job done.</p><p>She explained: “He was realistic. He’s like, ‘I don’t think you need that,’ or, ‘I think this is gonna fit you.'</p><p>“I just wanted to make sure that it was tasteful, and I was happy. I don’t want people to look at my chest before they look at me as an individual, and be like, ‘Oh my god.’”&nbsp;</p><p>After her surgery was complete, the mom of one recalled feeling "loopy" from the anesthesia and thinking&nbsp;“what have I done?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633245693-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633245688-1.jpg><p>Though after recovery she admitted the pain was "not that bad," she did note: “having my abdominal muscles put back together was probably one of the worst pains I’ve ever been in.”</p><p>In regards to the results, Madison is very pleased, telling Bravo: &nbsp;“I’m very happy with my results.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000630171813-3.png><p>"And I recommend it for anyone who has insecurities about something that they try to fix over and over. But, I recommend putting in the hard work before you go through a surgery.”</p><p>When asked if she will return to the surgeon's chair, the bright blonde was not convinced.</p><p>She said: “I think I’m done. I mean, I’m sure when I get older, there may be things that I’ll end up doing. Like yes, I do get Botox in my forehead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633245700.jpg><p>"Do I mess with anything else in my face? I don’t. I’m not gonna do anything.</p><p>"I’m not gonna try to&nbsp;fix my crooked lip&nbsp;that I was born with, ‘cause that’s just who I am.
