And as an FYI, "just ok" bangs are never an option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My personal bangs journey has included thick, blunt bangs, swoopy side bangs, and soft, textured fringe. Curtain bangs are one style I haven't tried, but I'm getting dangerously close to letting my bangs grow out to an extremely awkward, eye-poking length in order to get them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like other haircuts, the popularity of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curtain bangs</a> ebbs and flows. And right now, the cup is runneth over with examples of how to do face curtains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alexa Chung and Camila Cabello were early adopters of curtain bangs, now considered their signature hairstyles, but in the past year, everyone is adding Farah Fawcett-esque fringe to their hair, from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>J.Lo</a> to Taraji P. Henson, to the kids on TikTok.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a bang pro, people like to tell me about nice ones they've seen, whether it's on a cool girl in Brooklyn, or someone on TV. And it was recently brought to my attention by multiple people that Kaley Cucoco has some Very Good Bangs on her HBO series, The Flight Attendant. While I have not seen the show (I have a very long quarantine watch list, ok?), I have to agree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cucoco's curtain bangs are long and slightly featured and paired with face-framing layers, giving her cut a '70s vibe more so than '60s mod.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also demonstrates why curtain bangs are considered to be versatile. Cuoco's long, wispy strands look great when her hair is pulled up into a messy bun or a high ponytail, not unlike Ariana Grande's gravity-defying updo.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While curtain bangs trickled their way back into our consciousness pre-COVID, the look is in fact, the perfect pandemic hairstyle. For anyone who is taking advantage of seeing no one and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>growing out their bangs</a>, curtains are a great transitional cut for long, grown-out bangs. And for anyone who has decided to experiment with bangs during quarantine, curtains are low-maintenance as far as bangs go and possible to DIY on your own. (However, your stylist might not be happy about it.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Trim Your Own Bangs Without Screwing Them Up</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celebs brought curtain bangs back to the red carpet, while TikTokers introduced the vintaged-inspired look to the youth. And considering <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>everyone on TV has the same hair</a> (flat-on-top and loose-waves-on-the-bottom), Cuoco's bangs on The Flight Attendant are a sign that curtain bangs will be going strong into 2021 and beyond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2ejqcatsdJoopqkla56pMHOnKZmrJiaeqe4yKCfrWWRqcGmusOapa1lk6q%2Fta3Ip2SbmZ6cwA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
