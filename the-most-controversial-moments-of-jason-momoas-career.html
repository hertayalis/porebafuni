She told an anecdote about reading a lot on set because of all the time she spent suspended in various harnesses for the film's "underwater" scenes, and it turned out her co-star didn't like that hobby very much. "Jason's allergic to being ignored," Heard quipped, after agreeing with host Jimmy Fallon that Momoa is a "positive, happy dude." She revealed, "He can't sit still, so no matter what, he will push, prod, nudge, shove you, anything to get your attention." In order to cope, Heard revealed that Momoa found a way to make her pay attention to him: "He adopted this method of ripping out the last pages of my book, which is annoying. You get to the last 10 pages, and they'd just be gone."</p><p dir=ltr>Momoa himself told the same story himself at an <a href=#>IGN</a> event at Comic-Con, revealing that he gave her the pages back on the last day of shooting. Co-star Nicole Kidman looked confused and concerned by the story, while Patrick Wilson, who played the film's villain, cackled.</p><p dir=ltr>The anecdote didn't go over well online, to say the least.&nbsp;<a href=#>Jezebel</a>&nbsp;compared Momoa to Gaston, the book-averse Disney villain who tormented Belle in "Beauty and the Beast." Meanwhile, one fan shared how the story had soured her on the actor ... kind of.&nbsp;"He's now 33% less hot," they&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeted</a>&nbsp;in part.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGxpan92e9OhnGaln6jBbq%2FOp6urp6aav7S1wKVkpqedmru1v4yonWaikai8r3nMqKSomaNisKK%2BxJ6paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
