People had never seen anything like it and in the process it changed the way the mainstream thought about science fiction. Until then Sci-Fi had really easily dismissed as stuff of cheesy, low-budget garbage geared towards a bunch of kids, even if it wasn’t true.

The character of Mork was originally a guest star on <i>Happy Days</i> who later got his own, spin-off show. And that show, in turn, made Robin Williams a huge star.
