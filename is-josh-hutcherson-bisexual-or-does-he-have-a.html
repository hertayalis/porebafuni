Maybe I could say I’m 100% straight right now, but who knows? In a F**king year, I could meet a guy and be like, Whoa, I’m attracted to this person.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1580242659519913984_1.jpg><p>The actor is also a well-known founder of the anti-homophobic youth organization Straight But Not Narrow, who is currently dating actress Claudia Traisac, but that doesn’t imply he is any less accepting of LGBT concerns.</p><p>Furthermore, he said, ” I’ve met guys all the time that I’m like, ‘Damn, that’s a good-looking guy,’ you know? I’ve never been, like,’ Oh, I want to kiss that guy, I love women, but defining yourself as 100 percent anything is kind of near-sighted and close-minded.”</p><p>Finally, with all the statements given by the actor himself, it can be concluded by saying he is also not sure whether he is bisexual or not.</p><p>But, the actor is even more appreciated when he jokes that a threesome between Peeta, Katniss, and Gale would make the Hunger Games trilogy the best fantasy yet.</p><p>Read more: <a href=# rel=bookmark>What Happened To Kirra Hart Queensland?
