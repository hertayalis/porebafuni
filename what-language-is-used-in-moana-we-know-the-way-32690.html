In Samoan, the word can mean “<b>alas</b>” and “et cetera,” while in Maori it means both “woe” and “howl” or “cry.” If I had to guess, I would say that “alas” probably makes the most sense within the context of the song.</p><p>What does Pua mean in Moana? Pua, which means <b>“flower” in Hawaiian</b>, looks just as confused as Moana after meeting Maui for the first time.</p><p>Does Pua mean pig?

She looks to Te Kā and notices a spiral on the lava goddess’ chest, indicating that she is actually Te Fiti.</p><p>Who does Te Fiti look like?</p><table><tbody readability=7.5><tr><th>Te Fiti</th></tr><tr><td>Species</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Other Names</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Personality</td><td>Selfless, charitable, nurturing, graceful, forgiving, powerful, radiant</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Appearance</td><td><b>Towering, slender figure with skin</b> made of lush flora, green eyes, dark green lips, dark green eyebrows</td></tr></tbody></table><p>What does Hei Hei? “Heihei” (sometimes Hei Hei) in the same language, means <b>‘disturbance’ or an ‘interruption from the norm</b>. … everything.” Heihei attempts to ingest the rock before being forced to toss it back up.</p><h3>Is Frozen 3 coming out?</h3><p>The third section of Frozen is expected to be released in theaters <b>around 2023 or 2024</b>, according to Disney.</p><p>Are they making a frozen 3?

However, the creators of Moana did base Te Fiti on Tahiti, the largest island in French Polynesia.
