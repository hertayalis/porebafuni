Talking to Jeanne Ives, an Illinois-based podcast hoste, Wheeler's father said the 16-year-old noticed a couple of transgender individuals sitting in the girl's locker room and received no help from the head swim coach Alex Totura to whom she informed the situation.</p><p>At the monthly meeting which was conducted after a few weeks, parents also tried to grab the attention of the concerned authorities into the matter but the local branch's Chief Executive Officer Angie Sowle also responded to them saying no action could be taken in the situation. Parents requested asking trans individuals to use the private bathrooms and also to inform the swim team of the policy through an email. However, their requests were denied by the YMCA, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Fox News</a>.</p><h2 class=split>Head coach laughingly ignored Wheeler's concerns</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Internet just cannot stand Dave Portnoy as he denies dating 'trash bag' Raquel Leviss in shady post</a></p><p>A planned parent meeting over the situation was abruptly canceled and the head coach laughingly ignored Wheeler's concerns later, she and her teammate put up the protest signs in the area.

"16-yo girl banned from YMCA and kicked off her swim team for opposing a naked male in their locker room. And to make matters worse, her older sister had to go through the exact same thing with Lia Thomas. But it's 'not really happening'…." Gaines&nbsp; tweeted.

"The statement that the swimmer was removed from the Y and prevented from participating on the swim team is false. She left the swim team and the YMCA on her own," stated a YMCA spokesperson.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Who was Jonnie Angel Klein?
