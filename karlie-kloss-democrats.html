Making an appearance on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen yesterday, Kloss was asked about her affiliation with Trump through her husband, Joshua Kushner, who is the brother of presidential aide and Ivanka Trump's husband Jared Kushner.

Neasloney's creation was ranked towards the bottom.

"But I choose to focus on the values that I share with my husband, and those are the same liberal values that I was raised with and that have guided me throughout my life." Kloss and Kushner also did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite attempts to distance herself from the Trumps, Kloss and Ivanka have <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22550537/karlie-kloss-ivanka-trump-relationship/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reportedly been friends for years" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">reportedly been friends for years</a>.
