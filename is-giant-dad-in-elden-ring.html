Source: FromSoftware via TwitterThe lore behind Dark Souls games is long and complex — and since the original game was released in 2011, there's just as much meme lore around the franchise as new installments have been released.

While the build's origin story isn't entirely clear, it can be traced back to the 2012 YouTube video <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"HE'S BACK."</a> The edit consists of multiple clips of "Giant Dad" defeating others in a Dark Souls title and "pwning noobs."</p><p>But even if you can look past the video's offensively outdated quips, it does little to explain the point of Giant Dad — or even what stats make it a competitive opponent.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fandom</a> entry for Giant Dad, to create the character in a Dark Souls game, here are the skill levels you'll need:</p><ul><li>Soul Level 99</li><li>Bandit class</li><li>Vitality: 48</li><li>Attunement: 12</li><li>Endurance: 66</li><li>Strength: 16</li><li>Dexterity: 10 ("BUT DON’T TELL ANY1 U LEVELED THAT UP.")</li><li>Resistance: 10</li><li>Intelligence: 9</li><li>Faith: 8</li></ul><p>To complete the build, you'll also want to deck your character out with the following gear:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>can u giant dad on elden ring or no</p>— EMPLOYEE #000: VoidDweller (@VoidDweller000) <a href=#>March 23, 2022</a></figure><ul><li>Giant Armor</li><li>Giant Gauntlets</li><li>Giant Leggings</li><li>Mask of the Father</li><li>x2 Black Flame</li><li>“Well!
