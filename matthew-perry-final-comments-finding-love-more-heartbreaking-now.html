"I'm not being dramatic when I say there's 10 women on the face of the planet that I would kill to be married to," he told GQ in 2022. They were all his exes.&nbsp;</p><p>That same year, Perry told <a href=#>People</a> that love was something he still yearned for. The actor admitted that he'd always been the problem in his past relationships by being insecure and terrified of rejection. By reaching this realization and accepting it, he experienced some major personal growth. "Through a lot of work, I've got over that fear," he said. He was also starting to put a lot of thought into what traits would make someone his ideal partner. "A sense of humor, beautiful inside and out, caring. This is really important, somebody who can have a back and forth with me," he said. He also revealed that past experiences had made him wary of women who couldn't support themselves financially.</p><p>If he could find what he was looking for, <a href=#>Perry was very much ready to settle down</a>. "I'm feeling more confident and I'm not afraid of love anymore," he said. He added that his future plans definitely included starting a family. "I think I'd be great [as a dad]. I really do ... I can't wait."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjaH1xhI6mmK2smJrEbrzEq6myZZaeu6K4jJympqWVo8G0ecWipZ2hnpx6rbvVnmSmp6KaeqmxwKurm6qVlriqusZmpaivXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
