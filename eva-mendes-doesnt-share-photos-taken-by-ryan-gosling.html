In her first post, she sits on a swing wearing white-rimmed glasses; "Park life," she captioned it. Among the comments, one follower pegged the question, "How many of your photos are taken by Ryan?" In response, the actress cleared the air with, "None that I post. My friends take them and I take theirs. It's a girl thang."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mendes, who has been with Gosling for a decade now, has made it clear to fans and followers that she and her beau like to keep their relationship private. Last March, Mendes took the time to respond back in kind to a follower who shared that they "wouldn't mind" seeing more images of Gosling and the pair's life as a couple. "You look amazing, Eva! Just wanted to say how much it means to us fans to be able to talk to you and how great is that unlike many other celebrities you acknowledge us. So thank you! p.s. wouldn't mind an appearance by Ryan on this page," the commenter wrote on one of her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FiO6JD9XC/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=posts class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">posts</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a lengthy, considerate response, Mendes wrote back, "Thank you for saying this. I take so much joy from connecting to other women. It means so much to me. Even just a quick exchange. I struggle with Social Media but I love the constant connection with women. I try to post responsibly and I try to make sure I don't portray myself in a way that makes other women feel bad. Instagram can be hurtful in that way. Like with this picture, this is actually a campaign shot and it was retouched So I want women to know that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, "As far as Ryan, I'll only post [flashbacks] of things that are already ‘out there' (like pics from movies we did or stuff like that). My man and my kids are private. That's important to me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair first met back in 2011 on set for their movie, The Place Beyond the Pines. They currently share two daughters, Esmeralda and Amada Gosling.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
