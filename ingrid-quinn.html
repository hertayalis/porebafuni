He was going through a rough patch in his career in 1994.</p><p>During their early married life, she was very supportive and as strong as a nail. He had to work three to four nights a week for the shoot, and as a result, Ingrid became jealous and skeptical when her husband became comfortable with a female cast member of ‘Angel and Buffy.’</p><p>Ingrid would frequently pay him a surprise visit to check on him, but Davis did not appreciate her spying on him and filed for divorce after only five days of separation. The couple was unable to maintain their relationship and divorced in 1999, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple had no children together. Their divorce was caused by her ex-friendship husbands with his co-stars.</p><p>Following their divorce, David married actress Jamie Bergman on November 24, 2001, and the couple has two children: Jaden Boreanaz and Bella Boreanaz. Later that year, he admitted to cheating on his wife Jamie with his mistress.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>social worker</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Candi Fisher | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Candi Fisher, whose complete name is Candace Leigh Coogler, is the ex-wife of American football coach and former player Jimbo Fisher.
