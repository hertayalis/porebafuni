"I was watching that video and I was thinking to myself like, 'Man, do people realize how dope Kodak Black is, yo? Not just as a personality, but as a rapper, as an artist. You know these true hip-hop heads will be like 'Ah, man, you're talking about Kodak Black...'</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I look at Kodak Black the same way I look at Kendrick Lamar," he continued. "I'm not even joking. I feel like they're both two different levels of prolific. They're telling similar stories, just from different places. They're just <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">two different versions</a> of the same kid from the hood."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, a lot of fans might consider this a hot take. However, Charlamagne has plenty more where that came from, and other opinions of his caused even more debate. Recently, the media personality expressed his skepticism regarding <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chief Keef</a> when naming his list of the most influential rappers.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“No, you know why I don’t put&nbsp;Chief Keef&nbsp;in there?" he remarked. "Because Chief Keef <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">didn’t influence the world</a>, he influenced a sound of a region. Those four people I named literally influenced people all over the world.” Previously, the host mentioned his picks for the top spots. “I’m not going to say the order number, but there’s four: Kanye, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>, Pac and Wayne. The four most influential rappers of all time.”&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G Herbo</a> was one of many both inside and outside the rap game to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">disagree</a>. “What Charlamagne said, he don’t feel like Sosa is one of the most influential, like, globally but I disagree,” the Chicago MC expressed. “Probably right now you don’t feel like that ‘cause you got the Drakes, the Futures. You got so many but I feel like it wouldn’t be a lot of artists if it wasn’t for Sosa. I’m talking about a lot of styles, though.” Even the "Don't Like" MC himself <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">chimed in</a> on the debate.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, what do you think of Charlamagne Tha God praising Kodak Black and likening him to Kendrick Lamar?

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZ4Nzg5VmmqGZoqGurq3Gp5xmrJiWeqi7w2aamqScqHqsu8OaomaanJawrHnToZxmn5%2BWwW6vzqanmqqVqHqptcxmq6hlm5q7pb7InKJmpJGirrM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
