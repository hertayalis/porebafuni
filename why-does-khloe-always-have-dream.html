In December 2023, Khloé posted several holiday-themed Instagram posts with Dream and her two kids.</p><p>One photo was a carousel of The Kardashians star and the kids, as she expressed how grateful they were that they didn’t have a family Christmas photo. Then, in another post, Khloé posted photos and videos of Dream, True, and Tatum wearing matching PJs to celebrate the “MOST magical time of the year.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Khloé Kardashian (@khloekardashian)</a></p></figure><p>Dream has also been seen at Khloé’s house on The Kardashians.

Throughout the years, the family has been candid about Rob’s depression and disinterest in being on their family’s show. While Khloé has said Rob is hands-on in raising his daughter, she wants to support her brother by helping out with Dream.</p><p>“Rob does such an incredible job with her, and I'm just there to help whenever he needs.

I don't know if they like that or not, but it’s in my blood just to be a mom. I wouldn’t have it any other way."</p><p>“I feel like I'm like a third parent for Dream,” Khloé added. “I do know how important it is for Dream to have a great maternal influence — whether that be from me or her own mom or whoever, it's important, and wherever she gets it from, she gets it from."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Blac Chyna 💋 (@blacchyna)</a></p></figure><p>Khloé’s view of her and Dream’s relationship wasn’t something her non-fans agreed with.

Chyna seemingly agreed as she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> she wasn’t offended by Khloé stating she’s part of Dream’s tribe.</p><p>"Everything is good on both ends, we are all family at the end of the day. Robert and myself are co-parenting the best we can, and it's all love and positivity,” Chyna said in July 2023, adding, “Let's stop dragging the negativity o, and all move forward."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlm525sLGMmqOwmamoeqmt1Z5knaqVlro%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
