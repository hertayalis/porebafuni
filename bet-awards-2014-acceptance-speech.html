When you win an award five years in a row, you might think you would run out of things to say during your acceptance speeches. But Nicki Minaj was on incredible form as she collected the prize for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the BET Awards in Los Angeles last night (29th June).

Nicki initially used the speech to talk about her new album 'The Pink Print', but quickly side-stepped to talk about her peers who have said negative things about her recently, before wrapping it up with a revelation that she came close to death recently."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Because this is my fifth year winning this award and I don’t take it for granted, I really don’t.&nbsp;I thank god that I’ve been placed in a position to do something and represent women in a culture that is so male-driven. and I want you to know this — I want you to know that I have an album The Pink Print that’s coming out before the year ends. That’s not a plug but it’s a plug. But my point is, what I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is, that when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it.</p><p><br>"No, no, no shade. No, no, no shade. I used to sit in the studio with Wayne and I would literally take sometimes three, four days to write a verse. And he was like, No, you can’t be taking days to write no verse, you gotta write your verse right here in the studio. And that’s why I love him till this day. Because he pushed me to push my pen, and I’m still one of the only emcees that’s out here spitting metaphors and making you think. And I really don’t even care if I get my credit or if I don’t.</p><p>"I don’t look at myself as a female rapper, because I know what I do. And I thank my fans because they…&nbsp;…They might cut me off. This is so big. At one time black people was getting blacked out on the TV now they own their own network. This is big. This is different…&nbsp;…I just wanna say that, the other day, literally I didn’t tell anyone this, I really thought I was about to die. Like I was saying my prayers to die. And I didn’t even wanna call the ambulance because I thought well if I call the ambulance, it’s gonna be on TMZ. And I would rather sit there and die…and it made me realize, I don’t care what anybody gotta say.</p><p>"I’ma do me, I’ma do me. And I hope and pray that BET continues to honor authenticity. And that’s all I’m gonna say about that. Stephen I love you. It is what it is. Young Money till the death of me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pK3PoquapKipv6J6wqikaJmiqba0wNJopaKbm556rrXNmqFoppWswHCuxK1kmq%2BRp7G0eZFpaG1lkZiwprzTmqWcnV2ovaaxwqFm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
