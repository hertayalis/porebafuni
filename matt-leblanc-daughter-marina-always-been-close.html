And as it turns out, the "Friends" star isn't the only performer in his family. In a 2014 interview with People, LeBlanc raved about his daughter Marina's musical chops. "She has a beautiful voice. She has an audition for the talent show at her school today. I helped her to prepare some new pop song I don't know," he said. Singing wasn't Marina's only strong suit growing up. In an appearance on <a href=#>"The Ellen Show,"</a> LeBlanc talked about another talent of hers when he gave an update about Marina's interest in horseback riding, sharing that the almost 13-year-old was jumping in competitions.</p><p dir=ltr>Later in the interview, LeBlanc shared how his daughter had gotten the royal treatment — literally. When he, Marina, and his stepdaughter went backstage at a Bruce Springsteen concert, none other than <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> was there. LeBlanc revealed, "So, Prince Harry — at the end of the night — gives my stepdaughter and my daughter a kiss goodnight on the cheek. And they were both just floored."</p><p dir=ltr>Marina's a big fan of another icon — the one and only Rihanna. In 2016, her dad told People, "This year for her birthday, [Marina] said, 'I want you to get Rihanna to come.' And, I was like, 'I'll get right on that, sure.'" The gift of Queen RiRi IRL? What a birthday!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlZ4NxhY6mmK2sXaGyo7jAp5pmnJGqtKnAxKtkppminruiecClrpqxo2KvprHNZpqlp6OafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
