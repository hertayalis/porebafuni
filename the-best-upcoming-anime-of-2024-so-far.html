We looked amongst all of them and picked some standout anime that we think you should keep on your radar. While they won’t release for a bit, we know that anime fans are accustomed to waiting (like with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Attack on Titan</a>).</p><h2 id=h-moonrise data-injectable=false>Moonrise</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Moonrise is an action-adventure sci-fi anime being released by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> at some point in 2024.
