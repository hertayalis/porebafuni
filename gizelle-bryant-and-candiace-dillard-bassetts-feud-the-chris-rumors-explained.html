During an episode of "The Real Housewives of Potomac" Season 7, Bryant spoke to her BFF Robyn Dixon about an alleged moment she had with Chris Bassett after the Season 6 reunion that made her feel "completely uncomfortable." According to Bryant, Chris invited himself into her dressing room and closed the door to have a private conversation with the reality star. "Many a married man have tried me and I felt like he was trying to see if I was with it. I was complaining about his wife, so he was letting me know he was unhappy ... He's a sneaky link."</p><p dir=ltr>When the incident was mentioned to Candiace, she was naturally incensed and demanded to speak to a producer. "If it's going to be about maligning my f***ing husband, you don't want me here," she explained, adding that Ashley Darby's husband, Michael, was known for grabbing people's behinds. Bryant stood by her comments and stated during a confessional, "If he's doing things that are making people feel uncomfortable and nobody says anything to him, he's going to continue to do it." Following the accusations, both Candiace and Chris took to social media to slam Bryant for acting like a "victim."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphZoN6fI6goLOdnKGybq7RspinrF2Wu6V5wpqlnaGRmLJusMilo5qqlGKvor%2FSnqutq12bsrawjK2fnmWTnb%2Bqv4yrrKanoqh6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
