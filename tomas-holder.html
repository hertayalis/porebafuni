Despite being born into a loving family, His early life was not easy, as he had to endure bullying in high school for being skinny.</p><p>At just 16 years old, he was harassed and made insecure about his body. Going to school was a headache every day, and he didn’t feel like studying or leaving his house. The constant harassment challenged going to school, and he struggled with his self-esteem and confidence.</p><p>However, things improved when Tomas turned 17 and decided to start going to the gym. He spent the entire summer of 2018 training and educating himself about nutrition and workout.</p><p>He worked hard to progress, eating four meals daily and sticking to an essential rice, chicken, and egg diet. As he trained from Monday to Saturday, he noticed a significant change not only in his physique but also in his mindset.</p><p>After spending the summer training from Monday to Saturday, it was time to return to school. But this time, everything was different. Tomas realized that everyone is the way they are, and no one has the right to judge others by their physical appearance.</p><p>He understood that it is up to each person to want to change, but it’s not something they should feel obligated to do. In 2018, high school was completely different from previous years. The teasing stopped, the bullies disappeared, and those who laughed before asked for advice.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Tomas Holder with Pauli Balbi" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tomas-Holder-with-Pauli-Balbi.jpg alt="Tomas Holder with Pauli Balbi" width=400 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Who is Tomas Holder’s Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Tomas was previously in a relationship with Pauli Balbi.
