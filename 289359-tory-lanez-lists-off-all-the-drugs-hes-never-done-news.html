On Monday (June 15th), Tory shared a post on Instagram explaining that when it comes to drugs, he doesn't touch the stuff, unless it's of the cannabis variety.</p><p>"Fun Fact: The only drug I have ever done is weed. I never took a pill, not shrooms, coke, acid etc," he wrote on some photos of himself in his dressing room. In one of the shots, Tory is digging around in a labeled plastic bag full of bud, proving that he really is just a weed connoisseur and nothing else. He goes on to explain that, because he doesn't engage in these activities, his happiness is the result of a blessed life, not drugs. "I say this to say...that when u see me happy, it’s because I’m genuinely happy about my life, fans, and legacy I’m leaving behind for my family."</p><p><a href=# rel>Tory also recently explained his stance on&nbsp;weapons these days.</a>&nbsp;On his IG story, he noted that, "I've reached a place in life .. where it's like ... if I have to bring my gun to the function ... I don't need to be at the type of function anymore."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdibYZ0gZhmq6iqqWK5orrEs2SloaOpwG67xZ9kmqScYsGpsYydqa6fo2K1pr%2BMp5yvnaJisbC6xGalnq%2Bj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
