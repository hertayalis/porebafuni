Even though Wrestlers participated in the event after completion of the world championships, they are making the event one of a kind. While the USA’s wrestling team features world championships and previous experience holders, other participating wrestlers also have a stellar resume.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Thus, team USA has been facing fierce competition in the wrestling event at Pan American Games. While some of the wrestlers passed with flying colors, others failed to emerge victorious at the final Gold bouts. Similarly, team USA’s Elite Wrestler, Nashton Garett, was pinned by his opponent yesterday in the final bout, shattering USA’s dream of 5th gold at a wrestling event.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>Shattering Dream of Gold</span></h2><p><span>Nashton Garett embarked on the final bout yesterday against his opponent, Alejandro Valdes Tobier, from team Cuba. After locking horns on Pan American Mat, wrestling fans witnessed Garett falling short. A recent tweet by USA Wrestling was captioned, “</span><span>65 kg Men’s Freestyle Finals – Alejandro Valdes Tobier fall Nahshon Garrett 4:08.”</span></p><p><span>Alejandro Valdes Tobier, in the final bout, made it difficult for USA’s wrestling opponent to survive in the match. While Tobier secured the 6-point lead in the first half, Garett could not even clinch a single point. In the next half, Tobier continued to dominate the match by adding three more points.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Tobier not only pinned Garett on the Pan American Games mat but also secured a remarkable 9-0 victory. Thus, Toblier accomplished a gold medal while Garett settled with a silver. The 2nd November final matches could have been better for USA’s wrestlers as most of them fell short of accomplishing a win over their opponents.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>USA’s Wrestling Team’s performance on 2nd November</span></h2><p><span>Amongst the USA’s wrestling contenders participating in various events in wrestling at the Pan American Games, only one emerged victorious. In the women’s freestyle wrestling in the 86kg wrestling event, Forrest Moliari from Team USA pinned Caraballo <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>while securing 3-2 and a gold medal.</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>USA’s Premier Wrestling Club Flaunts Their World Champion “Titans” Months Ahead of Olympic Trials</a></strong></p><p><span>On the other hand, Mark Hall lost the gold medal bout, marking 1-3 and settling for a silver medal in the 86kg Men’s wrestling event. Overall, team USA’s four wrestlers competing for bronze and a gold bout were defeated by the opponents in the wrestling event. Eventually, the wrestling team added two silver and a gold medal to the collection, contributing to the USA’s collection of 55 silvers and 207 total medals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Watch This Story:&nbsp;</b><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><b>Fans Swarm to Meet Mike Tyson at His International Business Venture Which is Predicted to Make $160 Million Fiscal Year 2023</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SsZKyon6fBtHnNnq6sZZ%2Bhxq68yJyqZqaVrMBuw9Geqq2kmaO0brrEsKpmraOWwG6w0Z6YpmWfm3qntcWtn2avoprAtbjIp55mn5%2BhsW61zWanmqZdlrqmvsicmKdll5a6pr%2BMrJ%2BarKSav6awjJqqZqaRncCpu81mnpqqoprBtXnSnqutpJWoeqe70WaqoqSmmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
