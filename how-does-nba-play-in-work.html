For the casual fan, which is most of America, it’s when they start paying attention to more than the biggest names in the game.</p><p>One of the very few silver linings of the COVID-19 pandemic is the NBA Play-In Tournament, now officially the SoFi 2024 NBA Play-In Tournament. Not exactly the regular season, not exactly the playoffs, the play-in was created because of a COVID-related short season. Since it worked so well, it has become part of the structure of the season. Now the 10 best teams in each conference have a chance to play past mid-April. But what does the regular basketball fan need to know?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The NBA Play-In Tournament isn't nearly as complicated as it sounds.</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a> about the SoFi 2024 NBA Play-In Tournament on the NBA website starts simple and gets confusing. The "What is the Play-In Tournament?" section is clear and states, “The SoFi NBA Play-In Tournament will determine the teams that fill the seventh and eighth playoff seeds in each conference for the 2024 NBA playoffs.” Got it. Sounds straightforward.</p><p>The "How does the Play-In Tournament work?" section isn't straightforward. Instead of using the NBA’s language, we’ll lay it out.</p><p>The 7–10 teams in the standings in each conference have a chance to make the postseason. Team 7 and 8 play each other and Team 9 and 10 play each other. Whoever wins in 7 vs. 8 advances and becomes the 7 seed. Whoever wins in 9 vs. 10 plays the loser of 7 vs. 8. Whichever team wins that game is the 8 seed. Simple, right?</p><p>OK, it still sounds confusing, but it isn't. There’s a helpful graphic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NBA (@nba)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The Play-In Tournament games aren't playoff games.</h2><p>For reasons that are more confusing than the structure of the play-in tournament, these games don’t officially count as playoff games. While this doesn’t matter to the casual fan, it does for the NBA obsessive stat freaks.</p><p>While the only stat that actually means anything is who wins and loses, some historically great games are essentially in no man's land. For example, <a href=#>LeBron James</a> scored 22 points and had 11 rebounds and 10 assists for the Lakers in their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 play-in game victory</a> over the Golden State Warriors. But that didn’t count in his 2021 playoff record or his 2021 regular season record.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>For the super obsessive, you can find the stats for all play-in tournament games where you’d find stats for all games. You just need to change the season type on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA Advanced Stats page</a>. Located between All Star and In-Season Tournament are the records for these very watchable games.</p><p>Once again, the only stats that really matter are who wins. Considering the organization that represented the East in the last NBA Finals had to go through the play-in tournament, the <a href=#>Miami Heat</a>, just because a team finished around 0.500 for the regular season record doesn’t mean they can’t be the best team in the playoffs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOonKxlnpeubrzLmrBmoZ5ixLC%2Byg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
