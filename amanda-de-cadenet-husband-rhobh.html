However, it's always fun when a newbie does. Amanda, who has many jobs as a writer, photographer, and the host of her podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Conversation</a>, is also a rock star's wife and has been for quite some time.</p><p>Amanda married <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Valensi</a> in 2006 and have been together ever since. Nick is the lead guitarist of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Strokes</a> and has been with the band since 1998.</p><p>Additionally, Nick founded his band, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CRX</a>, in 2013, and often tours with and promotes both bands on his social media handles.</p><p>Amanda and Nick began dating in 2001, several years after her divorce from her first husband, <a href=#>Duran Duran</a> bass guitarist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Taylor</a>. Through her first marriage, Amanda had a daughter, Atlanta Noo Taylor.

"I’m a photographer; I interview people; I have multiple podcasts; I have shows in development; I’m a mom; I’m a pet owner; I’m a wife; I’m a friend. So, in my Google Calendar, each thing has a color. Like, blue is self-care. Red is interviews for one podcast; purple is interviews for another. A woman that I work with named Stephanie is basically the brain of all that structure. It’s like Tetris."</p><p>"And I’m a visual person and a tactile person, so I screengrab it and print it out every week," she continued. "And when I’m really overwhelmed, which I am periodically, I can look at the day and I cross things off and go: 'You are almost done.'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Amanda and Kyle's friendship will play out on 'RHOBH.'</h2><p>Amanda's seemingly solid marriage makes her a refreshing addition to RHOBH amid tons of divorce drama.
