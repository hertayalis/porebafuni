The two Taylors shared a sweet hug ahead of Swift gushing about Lautner to the crowd.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[Lautner] was a very positive force in my life when I was making the Speak Now album, and I want to say he did every single stunt that you saw in that music video,” Swift said. “He and his wife have become some of my closest friends, and it’s very convenient because we all share the same first name.” (Lautner is married to a nurse named Taylor Dome.)&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Returning Swift's kind words, Lautner told the singer, "I respect you so much. Not just for the singer you are, the songwriter, the performer — but truly for the human you are. You are gracious, humble, kind and I’m honored to know you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the video's release, Taylor shared several behind-the-scenes snapshots&nbsp;from set, which included a photo of herself, Lautner, and his wife recreating that iconic Spider-Man meme.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wrote this video treatment over a year ago and really wanted to play out symbolically how it’s felt for me to have the fans helping me reclaim my music,” Swift wrote in the caption. “I had my heart set on @joeyking, @taylorlautner and @helloimpresleycash starring in it. Joey and Presley had been in the video for ‘Mean’ when they were 9 and 13 and they are back and so ridiculously bad ass!! Taytay is INCREDIBLE in this (didn’t have a stunt double!) and shout out to [his wife, Taylor Dome] for being so awesome to hang with on set."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZK2ZqaG8s3nLmqytppWnerOx1KegqKZdnnqkrc1mqp6dXa68tnnMrqqim12rtqWxzmZubm1oZ4V3</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
