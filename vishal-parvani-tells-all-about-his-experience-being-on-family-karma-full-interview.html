I was crying my eyes out. Nani, oh my God, I love her.</p><p><strong>Love her too! I was worried going into it, but then it turned out so beautifully, so well done. Anything else we can expect from the season coming up on these next two batches of episodes?</strong></p><p>I just watched the next episode, and it's really funny, actually. But it does dive deeper into the whole Nani experience, and you get a lot more, I guess, heartwarming moments there and, I guess, anxiety as well. Then it's Friendsgiving. So, super excited, you got to see all the friends interacting together, and of course, there's always some light-hearted drama that ensues from there.</p><p><strong>I'm excited! I love the aspect of seeing a gay Indian wedding be planned on the show, too. That's going to be very fun to watch and see how it affects the family.</strong></p><p>I'm going to be the best man. That's my best friend.</p><p><strong>That's going to be big!</strong></p><p>He's the one that introduced me to Richa as well. They both went to law school together, so we're very, very intertwined.</p><p><strong>What a full circle moment. Did you have anything else to add about the show that I may not have asked?</strong></p><p>Well, the show, you have to keep watching 9:00 p.m., on Wednesdays, on Bravo. It gets better and better, and I don't know a single person that can't say anything good about the show. The show is fantastic, phenomenal, and everyone needs to watch it. Tell their mothers, tell their daughters, tell their sons, it is the best show. Because you know what? We have the best friends, and family.</p><p><strong>Your official Wednesday appointment television right there on Bravo. Do you watch the episodes as they air?</strong></p><p>I do, and I try to live tweet it sometimes, or engage a little bit on what's going on.</p><p>"<a href=#>Family Karma</a>"&nbsp;airs on Wednesdays at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5gZ4Fye9WiqqGZnGK9or7VmqWiZaSaua2%2FjJqjpWWRl7y2wIyhoKxlla29pr7InqWcnV2Xsqq6xmamp2WWlrqquNhmopqqnZZ6p8HLpWSipqSav7e1xLBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
