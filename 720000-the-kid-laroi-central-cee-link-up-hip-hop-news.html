Trippie Red previewed some new music he made with LAROI to build up hype with fans. That paid off when he dropped Love Letter To You 5 where <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">LAROI appears on the song "Wind." </a>He stands among an already impressive feature list that also includes <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Roddy Ricch</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Bryson Tiller</a>, and many more.

His debut album The First Time was rumored to drop earlier this year but ultimately never materialized. He described the sound of his new album in an Instagram post. It's supposed to include a variety of genres or as he says "rap sh*t, alternative sh*t, kind of pop sh*t on there, too, R&B.”&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If that wasn't enough to get fans excited LAROI also believes his new sound is his best yet. "It's the best material I've ever made," he confidently declares in the same Instagram post.
