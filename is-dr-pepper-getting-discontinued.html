Or has it? Rumors have been swirling that the soda is being discontinued in the near future, and to say it‚Äôs caused a ruckus would be an understatement.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the potential discontinuation of Dr. Pepper.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Dr. Pepper discontinued?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@drpepper href=#>@drpepper</a><p>well this is awkward because we‚Äôre not going anywhere ü´∂</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Dr Pepper" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Dr Pepper</a></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>In short, Dr. Pepper is not being discontinued. As stated above, Dr. Pepper is the 4th most popular soft drink in the United States. The soda, which isn‚Äôt considered a cola, root beer, or fruit-flavored drink, sells around 632 million cases a year. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keurig</a> Dr. Pepper, which manufactures the drink for the Coca-Cola company, Dr. Pepper generates around 14.5 billion dollars a year worldwide.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>That number might be a fraction of what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Coca-Cola</a> makes a year (somewhere around $32 billion), but the manufacturer would be crazy to discontinue the line. Even so, rumor mills are working overtime to grind out this Dr. Pepper myth.</p><h2 id=h-where-did-the-dr-pepper-rumor-come-from data-injectable=false>Where did the Dr. Pepper rumor come from?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>press release attached <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/faJ3tNZW4k</a></p>‚Äî Dr Pepper (@drpepper) <a href=#>March 1, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Around the end of February, rumors that Dr. Pepper was being discontinued flooded onto TikTok. Users were quick to react with outrage, depression, and ‚Äî in the case of those Dr. Pepper haters ‚Äî joy. Users flocked to the site to drop their hot takes, with a large percentage of Texans willing to wage war for their favorite drink.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Dr. Pepper was originally manufactured in Waco, Texas and 100 years later, Texans drink a staggering amount of the beverage. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas Monthly</a>, every man, woman, and child in the state drinks approximately 1 can of Dr. Pepper every 3 days.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Despite Dr. Pepper denying the rumor on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> and X, formerly Twitter, it‚Äôs continued to spread like wildfire. Users have tried to pinpoint why this tall tale is spreading so rapidly, but they‚Äôve had little success. Regardless of where the rumor came from or why, rest easy knowing that Dr. Pepper is going nowhere fast. An official spokesperson for the company had this to say:</p><p>‚ÄúHey internet, You can all cool your thumbs, because Dr Pepper is not being discontinued. *applause* This rumor started with a TikTok video posted earlier this week. No more Dr Pepper would be very upsetting. World crushing. The worst of all time. But you have nothing to worry about. Dr Pepper isn‚Äôt going anywhere. These 23 flavors are 4 life.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeWrrZwtdJmm6tloJq9sbHRZp6erKSeu6h5w6KqnKeeqbavwcSdZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
