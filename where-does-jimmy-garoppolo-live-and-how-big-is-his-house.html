Garappolo bunked down the in "decaying basement" with John Wurm, who later described their living conditions by saying, "Our house got so trashed."</p><p>"There were four or five steps to get down there, and those damn steps kept breaking," Wurm told The Athletic&nbsp;while describing the basement. "It was almost like you were going down to a crawl space. There were times when you had to jump downstairs. We had the smallest little bathroom ever. It just felt like you weren't going to where someone would live. It was like, 'Are people supposed to go down there?'" Yikes!</p><p>While that certainly sounds wild, Garoppolo was surely prepared to rough it in some ways, thanks to his upbringing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBmbYFze9ahnKudXZm8pr%2BMo6CmpalitKK%2BzqmnqKSfYrmqwsRmmKecXZ28uHnBop5moaNitaq%2FjKGmrquVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
