According to the original poster, the phrase was first used in a 2018 episode of the show.</p><p>“When Gary finds the cross, Rick says into his phone, ‘It's not Bravo Tango…’ in a way that suggests something with words beginning with B and T would have been better. What is he talking about? Why is he talking in UN code language?” the user asked.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Rick and Marty are men on a mission, which is likely why they use lingo like “Bravo Tango” on the show. We assume that the coded term was derived from the military phonetic alphabet in which the word "Bravo" indicates that the first word in the phrase starts with a “B,” while the second word starts with a “T.”</p><p>Some viewers have joked that the phrase could mean “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beef tacos</a>” or “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bulls—t theories</a>." But given the nature of the show and the context in which the phrase is normally used, we’re going to go ahead and say that “Bravo Tango” is code for either “big treasure” or “buried treasure.”</p><p>Watch the cast as they attempt to uncover more “Bravo Tango” on new episodes of The Curse of Oak Island, airing on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on the HISTORY Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Biws5mq5qml6R6rrHAp6Cnn12ku267wKRkoquclrul</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
