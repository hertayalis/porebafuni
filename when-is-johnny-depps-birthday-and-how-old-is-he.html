Born in a small Kentucky town, Owensboro, Depp is the youngest of four siblings, and his parents were a waitress named Betty Sue, and John Christopher (whom Johnny was named after). Depp’s parents divorced when he was 15, and his mother would go on to marry a man named Robert Palmer — who Depp felt inspired and loved by deeply.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>In a conversation with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>, Depp shared the meaning of a song he wrote and performed for his late stepfather:</p><p>“So the words of the song was this&nbsp;toast by my stepfather,&nbsp;who made his exit about 15 years ago. He was this really cool guy. He was a bit of a rounder. He spent about half his life in prison, in Statesville Ill. And&nbsp;he had this toast. ‘Here’s to you, as good as you are. Here’s to&nbsp;me, as bad as I am.&nbsp;You’re still as good as you are, as bad as I am.'”</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Depp has experienced several ups and downs in his personal and professional life, and as he celebrates his first birthday without his friend and partner in music, Jeff Beck, things are feeling bittersweet at this moment in time. Depp dedicated a song to Beck, at his performance in Bucharest, Romania, on Thursday, and it was none other than David Bowie’s “Heroes.”</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=856 data-injectable=true>It goes without saying that this is a birthday full of emotion for Depp, after a lengthy and very public battle with his ex-wife, the loss of a close friend, and other changes in his life — but he’s finding the positives in each day and enjoying them for what they are. As he honors his birthday this year and celebrates this new chapter of his life, Depp will undeniably be soaking it all in and embracing this next year of opportunity in every sense of the word.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-johnny-depp data-injectable=false>How old is Johnny Depp?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Greg Williams (@gregwilliamsphotography)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>So how old is Depp turning today?

As he celebrates his birthday this year, he’s looking forward and staying true to himself.</p><p>“Do I feel boycotted now? No, not at all, but I don’t feel boycotted by Hollywood because I don’t think about it. I don’t think about Hollywood. I don’t have much further need for Hollywood myself. I keep wondering about the word comeback because I didn’t go anywhere. As a matter of fact, I live about 45 minutes away. So yeah, maybe people stopped calling out of whatever their fear was at the time. But no, I didn’t go nowhere. I’ve been sitting around.”</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>As he rings in 60, sources close to Depp say he’s happy, and that’s the greatest gift anyone could receive on their special day.
